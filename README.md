# Magento CSV(huge) Export Extension

Extension that enables the generation of large CSV files.

With this extension you can generate and download huge csv files. Every time you need a updated csv you can go to the admin panel and trigger the cron. 
The cron is only executed when you say so, I mean, you say to the extension: I want a new updated csv! This behaviour avoids wasting of processing. (LetÂ´s save the environment!)

### You can use as many attributes as you want, these are just a few simple example. 

Customers Header
```bash
name;email;gender:dob
```
Customers Template
```bash
{{var customer.name}};{{var customer.email}};{{var customer.gender}};{{var customer.dob}}
```

Orders Header
```bash
increment_id;created_at;grand_total;customer_email
```

Orders Template
```bash
{{var order.increment_id}};{{var order.created_at}};{{var order.grand_total}};{{var order.customer_email}}
```

Catalog Header
```bash
name;sku;price

```
Catalog Template
```bash
{{var product.name}};{{var product.sku}};{{var product.price}}
```

You can also use loops if you need iterate through order items, e.g.:
```bash
{{for item in order.all_visible_items}}
{{var loop.index}};{{var item.sku}};{{var item.name}};{{var item.price}};{{var item.ordered_qty}}
{{/for}} 
```
## Documentation

The code is self explanatory but if you have any questions, do not hesitate in contacting me.

If you do not know how to create a mysql view, is pretty simple:

Supposing that you have this query to extract the coupon usage report:

```bash
select u.coupon_id, c.code, count(*) as total from salesrule_coupon_usage u, salesrule_coupon c where u.coupon_id=c.coupon_id  group by u.coupon_id;
```
And the query for creating the view becomes:

```bash
create view view_coupon_usage AS select u.coupon_id, c.code, count(*) as total from salesrule_coupon_usage u, salesrule_coupon c where u.coupon_id=c.coupon_id  group by u.coupon_id;
```

This is it. Pretty simple. If you open your database, you will probably see a new table (view) "view_coupon_usage"

Now you can go to Report > CSV Reports > Add Report and create a new custom report. (use the same view name "view_coupon_usage" in this case)
